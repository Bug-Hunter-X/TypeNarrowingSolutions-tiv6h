This bug demonstrates a type narrowing issue in TypeScript when dealing with function parameters that can be null.  The issue occurs when passing a null value to a function expecting a string | null.  While direct assignment of null to a string | null variable works, passing null as a function argument can result in a type error, even if the function's logic correctly handles the null case. The solution involves using type assertions or re-evaluating the function's parameter type to address the issue.
